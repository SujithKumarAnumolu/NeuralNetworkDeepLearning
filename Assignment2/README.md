Description: This repository consists of python code for three coding questions of Assignment 2 of Neural Network and Deep Learning.

QUESTION
1) Write a program that takes two strings from the user: first_name, last_name. Pass these variables to
fullname function that should return the (full name).
A) The two functions, fullname and string_alternative, as well as the main execution block of the program are defined by this code. To create a full name, the fullname function concatenates the first and last names. Every other character in a given string is returned by the string_alternative function. The first and last names entered by the user are gathered in the main function, the complete name is created using the fullname function, and the output of string_alternative applied to the full name is shown. If the script is run directly, the program is run by invoking the main function.

2) Write a python program to find the wordcount in a file (input.txt) for each line and then print the output.
o Finally store the output in output.txt file.
A) Text file processing functions are defined by this code: File processing takes an input file, uses frequencyOfWords to compute word frequencies, and then sends the results to an output file. frequencyOfWords determines the frequency of each word in a given phrase. The findings are written to output.txt after processing a sample text input file that has been created. Eventually, it uses the files from Google Collaboration to download input.txt and output.txt to the local computer and displays the contents of output.txt.the function to download.

3) Write a program, which reads heights (inches.) of customers into a list and convert these
heights to centimeters in a separate list using:
1) Nested Interactive loop.
2) List comprehensions
A) Users can provide a list of heights in inches, and this Python script will convert those heights into centimeters using a list comprehension and a conventional loop (getHeightUsingLoop function). The results will be printed out. The getHeightUsingLoop function rounds the result to two decimal places, iterates over each height in inches, multiplies it by 2.54, and gathers the converted heights in a list. The primary function accepts user input, applies both algorithms to the input list, then produces the converted heights for comparison.
